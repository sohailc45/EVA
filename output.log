            Question: What is MaximEyes.com?
            Answer: MaximEyes.com is a Health IT Module that is ONC 2015 Edition Cures compliant and has been certified by an ONC-ACB for use in the MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System) program.
            Image Description: The image is a solid blue color. It is likely a placeholder image used in a FAQ document, as it does not contain any relevant information. The blue color is a common choice for placeholder images, as it is neutral and does not distract from the text. 

This image would be relevant to FAQ questions that are about the image itself, such as:

* "Why is there a blue image on this page?"
* "What does the blue image represent?"
* "Is there supposed to be an image here?"

Since the image is simply a placeholder, it would not be relevant to any other type of FAQ question.


            On a scale of 0 to 1, how relevant is this image to the question and answer?
            NOTE: Provide only a number as the response, with 1 being highly relevant and 0 being not relevant at all.

            Answer: MaximEyes.com is a Health IT Module that is ONC 2015 Edition Cures compliant and has been certified by an ONC-ACB for use in the MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System) program.
            Image Description: The image is a logo for a patient portal powered by Updox. The logo features a stylized blue eye with a vertical line extending downwards, resembling a lollipop. Below the logo, the words "patient portal" and "powered by Updox" are written in blue.  

This image is relevant to an FAQ document as it visually represents the topic of patient portals and Updox, making it easier for users to identify relevant FAQs related to accessing or using the patient portal. 

The image can be used as metadata for a RAG solution to improve the relevance of FAQ questions by:

* **Image tagging:** Tagging the image with keywords such as "patient portal," "Updox," "healthcare," and "technology" can help the RAG solution identify relevant FAQs.
* **Image embedding:** Embedding the image in a vector space can help the RAG solution find similar images and related FAQ content.
* **Contextual relevance:** Using the image as a visual cue for users can help them quickly find relevant FAQs without needing to read through lengthy text descriptions.

            Question: What is maximeyes.com?
            Answer: MaximEyes.com is a Health IT Module that is ONC 2015 Edition Cures compliant and has been certified by an ONC-ACB for use in the MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System) program.
            Image Description: The image is a solid blue color. It is likely a placeholder image used in a FAQ document, as it does not contain any relevant information. The blue color is a common choice for placeholder images, as it is neutral and does not distract from the text. 

This image would be relevant to FAQ questions that are about the image itself, such as:

* "Why is there a blue image on this page?"
* "What does the blue image represent?"
* "Is there supposed to be an image here?"

Since the image is simply a placeholder, it would not be relevant to any other type of FAQ question.


            On a scale of 0 to 1, how relevant is this image to the question and answer?
            NOTE: Provide only a number as the response, with 1 being highly relevant and 0 being not relevant at all.

            Answer: MaximEyes.com is a Health IT Module that is ONC 2015 Edition Cures compliant and has been certified by an ONC-ACB for use in the MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System) program.
            Image Description: The image is a solid blue color. It is likely a placeholder image used in a FAQ document, as it does not contain any relevant information. The blue color is a common choice for placeholder images, as it is neutral and does not distract from the text. 

This image would be relevant to FAQ questions that are about the image itself, such as:

* "Why is there a blue image on this page?"
* "What does the blue image represent?"
* "Is there supposed to be an image here?"

Since the image is simply a placeholder, it would not be relevant to any other type of FAQ question.


            On a scale of 0 to 1, how relevant is this image to the question and answer?
            NOTE: Provide only a number as the response, with 1 being highly relevant and 0 being not relevant at all.

            Image Description: The image is a logo for a patient portal powered by Updox. The logo features a stylized blue eye with a vertical line extending downwards, resembling a lollipop. Below the logo, the words "patient portal" and "powered by Updox" are written in blue.  

This image is relevant to an FAQ document as it visually represents the topic of patient portals and Updox, making it easier for users to identify relevant FAQs related to accessing or using the patient portal.

            Question: How can I organize items Eyeclinic patient portal inbox?
            Answer: According to the provided context, you can organize items in the EyeClinic patient portal inbox by using queues.
            Image Description: The image shows a screen capture of a patient portal interface. The top of the screen displays a green box with the text "Stephanie Edwards" in it. The text "Send to Patient Portal from the practice" is displayed below the box. A white text box is beneath it, with the label "Subject". A checkbox with the text "Send as practice" is highlighted with a mouse cursor hovering over it. Another checkbox with the text "Include attachments" is located below this checkbox. A dropdown menu titled "Select..." can be seen below the checkboxes. There is a button with the text "47 YRS (1975-01-25)" and another button with the text "FEMALE". A portion of a search box on the right side of the image is also visible. 

This image is relevant to a FAQ document because it shows a user interface that is likely related to sending information to a patient portal. This is a common function that users may need to understand, and the image can be used to illustrate the process. The FAQ document could address questions such as:

* What are the different options for sending a message?
* How do I include attachments in a message?
* What does "Send as practice" mean?
* What are the different types of messages that I can send?

In addition to being used as an illustration, the image could also be used as a metadata tag for the FAQ document. This would allow the RAG solution to identify the document as relevant to questions about patient portals and message sending.

[32;1m[1;3m if the user query is related to booking an appointment, do not use the following tools:
    query_chroma_and_generate_response
    fetch_info
    get_greeting_response
    generate_response
    instead, use the fetch_info tool to extract the user's information and the generate_response tool to generate a response.
    However, in this case, the user query is to book an appointment, so we should use the fetch_info tool to extract the user's information and the generate_response tool is not needed.
    but we need to book the appointment so use fetch_info tool
